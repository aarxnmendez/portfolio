    "I'm Aarón Méndez, born in A Coruña, Galicia. I've been in front of a computer since I was young. I started with Excel, organizing schoolwork. I've always liked having everything well structured, order is something that defines me. Later, in high school, the ICT subject introduced me to Scratch and programming. It was the only subject where I'd lose track of time. That's when I knew this was my thing.",
    "Now I'm studying **Computer Engineering** and I've already completed a higher vocational training in Web Application Development. What excites me most is **modern, interactive frontend**: creating interfaces that not only work well, but hook you in.",
    "I work with total focus on one thing at a time. No multitasking. Just focus and persistence until I get the result. About the future, I stay flexible: right now it's frontend, tomorrow it might be something else. And I like that uncertainty.",
